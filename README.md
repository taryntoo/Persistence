# Persistence

My lecture notes and files for a presentation on Digital Persistence and Transfer schemes. 
This was presented to South Florida Cocoa developers in April, 2015.

PLists and CoreData were only mentioned in passing, since the attendees were already familiar with them.

The examples are taken from applications I wrote between 2013 and 2015 to manage several body-worn BLE-enabled medical monitors.
